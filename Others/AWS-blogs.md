# Blogs by AWS

There are a good number of blogs on AWS and below are some of them I do follow on a regular basis using [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/). As usual AWS or any other company will write biased blogs on their own services/products etc (who wouldn't do it, I would have done the same). So, at the end there are some blogs by non-AWS companies and individuals around AWS.
