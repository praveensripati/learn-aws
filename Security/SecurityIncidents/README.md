# Security Incidents around AWS

Security in the AWS or any other Cloud is a [shared responsibility](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/). For ex., the infrastructure responsibility is on AWS and to make sure that the right users have the access to the right data at the right time is the responsibility of the Cloud user.

Fow what ever reason, there had been a few security breaches in the Cloud. This page is all about consolidating such incidents in AWS. It doesn't mean that AWS is not secure and other Clouds are secure. It's just a collection of security incidents around AWS.
