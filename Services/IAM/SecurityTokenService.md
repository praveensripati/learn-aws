# STS (Security Token Service)

You can use the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to create and provide trusted users with temporary security credentials that can control access to your AWS resources. Temporary security credentials work almost identically to the long-term access key credentials that your IAM users can use. No need to create a user in IAM. The access is given temporarily.

STS Supports

    - Enterprise identity federation (SAML 2.0 with Microsoft Active Directory).
    - Web identity federation (Amazon, FB, Google or any OpenID Connect (OIDC) 2.0 compatible provider.
